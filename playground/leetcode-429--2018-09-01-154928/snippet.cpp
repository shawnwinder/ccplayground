 * Total Accepted:    5.5K
 * Total Submissions: 10.3K
 * Testcase Example:  '{"$id":"1","children":[{"$id":"2","children":[{"$id":"5","children":[],"val":5},{"$id":"6","children":[],"val":6}],"val":3},{"$id":"3","children":[],"val":2},{"$id":"4","children":[],"val":4}],"val":1}'
 *
 * Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values.
 * (ie, from left to right, level by level).
 *
 * For example, given a 3-ary tree:
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * We should return its level order traversal:
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * [
 * ⁠    [1],
 * ⁠    [3,2,4],
 * ⁠    [5,6]
 * ]
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *
 * The depth of the tree is at most 1000.
 * The total number of nodes is at most 5000.
