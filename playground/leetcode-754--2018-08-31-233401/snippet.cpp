 * Total Submissions: 16.7K
 * Testcase Example:  '1'
 *
 *
 * You are standing at position 0 on an infinite number line.  There is a goal
 * at position target.
 *
 * On each move, you can either go left or right.  During the n-th move
 * (starting from 1), you take n steps.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of steps required to reach the destination.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: target = 3
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * On the first move we step from 0 to 1.
 * On the second step we step from 1 to 3.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: target = 2
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * On the first move we step from 0 to 1.
 * On the second move we step  from 1 to -1.
 * On the third move we step from -1 to 2.
 *
 *
 *
 * Note:
 * target will be a non-zero integer in the range [-10^9, 10^9].
