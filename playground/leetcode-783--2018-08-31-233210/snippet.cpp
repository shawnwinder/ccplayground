/*
 * [799] Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes

 * algorithms
 * Easy (48.31%)
 * Total Accepted:    15.7K
 * Total Submissions: 32.5K
 * Testcase Example:  '[4,2,6,1,3,null,null]'
 *
 * Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the root node root, return the minimum
 * difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.
 *
 * Example :
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3,null,null]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * Note that root is a TreeNode object, not an array.
 *
 * The given tree [4,2,6,1,3,null,null] is represented by the following
 * diagram:
 *
 *          4
 *        /   \
 *      2      6
 *     / \
 *    1   3
 *
 * while the minimum difference in this tree is 1, it occurs between node 1 and
 * node 2, also between node 3 and node 2.
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *
 * The size of the BST will be between 2 and 100.
 * The BST is always valid, each node's value is an integer, and each node's
 * value is different.
 *
