/*
 * [676] Implement Magic Dictionary

 * Medium (49.37%)
 * Total Accepted:    15.9K
 * Total Submissions: 32.3K
 * Testcase Example:  '["MagicDictionary", "buildDict", "search", "search", "search", "search"]\n[[], [["hello","leetcode"]], ["hello"], ["hhllo"], ["hell"], ["leetcoded"]]'
 *
 *
 * Implement a magic directory with buildDict, and search methods.
 *
 *
 *
 * For the method buildDict, you'll be given a list of non-repetitive words to
 * build a dictionary.
 *
 *
 *
 * For the method search, you'll be given a word, and judge whether if you
 * modify exactly one character into another character in this word, the
 * modified word is in the dictionary you just built.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: buildDict(["hello", "leetcode"]), Output: Null
 * Input: search("hello"), Output: False
 * Input: search("hhllo"), Output: True
 * Input: search("hell"), Output: False
 * Input: search("leetcoded"), Output: False
 *
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * You may assume that all the inputs are consist of lowercase letters a-z.
 * For contest purpose, the test data is rather small by now. You could think
 * about highly efficient algorithm after the contest.
 * Please remember to RESET your class variables declared in class
 * MagicDictionary, as static/class variables are persisted across multiple
 * test cases. Please see here for more details.
