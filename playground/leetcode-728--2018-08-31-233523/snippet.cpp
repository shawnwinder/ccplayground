 *
 *
 * A self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it
 * contains.
 *
 * For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because 128 % 1 == 0, 128 % 2 ==
 * 0, and 128 % 8 == 0.
 *
 * Also, a self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.
 *
 * Given a lower and upper number bound, output a list of every possible self
 * dividing number, including the bounds if possible.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input:
 * left = 1, right = 22
 * Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]
 *
 *
 *
 * Note:
 * The boundaries of each input argument are 1 .
