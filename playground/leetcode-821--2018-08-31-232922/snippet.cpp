 * Testcase Example:  '"loveleetcode"\n"e"'
 *
 * Given a string S and a character C, return an array of integers representing
 * the shortest distance from the character C in the string.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: S = "loveleetcode", C = 'e'
 * Output: [3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0]
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *
 * S string length is in [1, 10000].
 * C is a single character, and guaranteed to be in string S.
 * All letters in S and C are lowercase.
