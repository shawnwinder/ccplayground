 * [783] Search in a Binary Search Tree

 * Total Submissions: 13.3K
 * Testcase Example:  '[4,2,7,1,3]\n2'
 *
 * Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value. You need to
 * find the node in the BST that the node's value equals the given value.
 * Return the subtree rooted with that node. If such node doesn't exist, you
 * should return NULL.
 *
 * For example, 
 *
 *
 * Given the tree:
 * ⁠       4
 * ⁠      / \
 * ⁠     2   7
 * ⁠    / \
 * ⁠   1   3
 *
 * And the value to search: 2
 *
 *
 * You should return this subtree:
 *
 *
 * ⁠     2
 * ⁠    / \
 * ⁠   1   3
 *
 *
 * In the example above, if we want to search the value 5, since there is no
 * node with value 5, we should return NULL.
 *
 * Note that an empty tree is represented by NULL, therefore you would see the
 * expected output (serialized tree format) as [], not null.
