/*
 * [71] Simplify Path

 * Medium (26.91%)
 * Total Accepted:    123K
 * Total Submissions: 457K
 * Testcase Example:  '"/home/"'
 *
 * Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it.
 *
 * For example,
 * path = "/home/", => "/home"
 * path = "/a/./b/../../c/", => "/c"
 *
 * Corner Cases:
 *
 *
 * Did you consider the case where path = "/../"?
 * In this case, you should return "/".
 * Another corner case is the path might contain multiple slashes '/' together,
 * such as "/home//foo/".
 * In this case, you should ignore redundant slashes and return "/home/foo".
