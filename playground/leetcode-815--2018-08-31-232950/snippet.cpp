/*
 * [833] Bus Routes
 *

 *
 * algorithms
 * Hard (33.93%)
 * Total Accepted:    6.6K
 * Total Submissions: 19.6K
 * Testcase Example:  '[[1,2,7],[3,6,7]]\n1\n6'
 *
 * We have a list of bus routes. Each routes[i] is a bus route that the i-th
 * bus repeats forever. For example if routes[0] = [1, 5, 7], this means that
 * the first bus (0-th indexed) travels in the sequence
 * 1->5->7->1->5->7->1->... forever.
 *
 * We start at bus stop S (initially not on a bus), and we want to go to bus
 * stop T. Travelling by buses only, what is the least number of buses we must
 * take to reach our destination? Return -1 if it is not possible.
 *
 *
 * Example:
 * Input:
 * routes = [[1, 2, 7], [3, 6, 7]]
 * S = 1
 * T = 6
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * The best strategy is take the first bus to the bus stop 7, then take the
 * second bus to the bus stop 6.
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= routes.length <= 500.
 * 1 <= routes[i].length <= 500.
 * 0 <= routes[i][j] < 10 ^ 6.
