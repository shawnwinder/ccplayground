 * algorithms
 * Easy (34.36%)
 * Total Accepted:    6.3K
 * Total Submissions: 18.2K
 * Testcase Example:  '[[4,3,8,4],[9,5,1,9],[2,7,6,2]]'
 *
 * A 3 x 3 magic square is a 3 x 3 grid filled with distinct numbers from 1 to
 * 9 such that each row, column, and both diagonals all have the same sum.
 *
 * Given an grid of integers, how many 3 x 3 "magic square" subgrids are
 * there?  (Each subgrid is contiguous).
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: [[4,3,8,4],
 *        [9,5,1,9],
 *        [2,7,6,2]]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * The following subgrid is a 3 x 3 magic square:
 * 438
 * 951
 * 276
 *
 * while this one is not:
 * 384
 * 519
 * 762
 *
 * In total, there is only one magic square inside the given grid.
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= grid.length <= 10
 * 1 <= grid[0].length <= 10
 * 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 15
