 * Testcase Example:  '[2,2,3,2]'
 *
 * Given a non-emptyÂ array of integers, every element appears three times
 * except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement
 * it without using extra memory?
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: [2,2,3,2]
 * Output: 3

 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
 * Output: 99
