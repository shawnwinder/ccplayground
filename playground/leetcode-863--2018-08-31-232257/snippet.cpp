 * Total Accepted:    6.5K
 * Total Submissions: 15.9K
 * Testcase Example:  '[3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]\n5\n2'
 *
 * We are given a binary tree (with root node root), a target node, and an
 * integer value K.
 *
 * Return a list of the values of all nodes that have a distance K from the
 * target node.  The answer can be returned in any order.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, K = 2
 *
 * Output: [7,4,1]
 *
 * Explanation:
 * The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5)
 * have values 7, 4, and 1.
 *
 *
 *
 * Note that the inputs "root" and "target" are actually TreeNodes.
 * The descriptions of the inputs above are just serializations of these
 * objects.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *
 * The given tree is non-empty.
 * Each node in the tree has unique values 0 <= node.val <= 500.
 * The target node is a node in the tree.
 * 0 <= K <= 1000.
 *
