/*
 * [809] Preimage Size of Factorial Zeroes Function

 *
 * algorithms
 * Hard (40.26%)
 * Total Accepted:    3.6K
 * Total Submissions: 8.9K
 * Testcase Example:  '0'
 *
 * Let f(x) be the number of zeroes at the end of x!. (Recall that x! = 1 * 2 *
 * 3 * ... * x, and by convention, 0! = 1.)
 *
 * For example, f(3) = 0 because 3! = 6 has no zeroes at the end, while f(11) =
 * 2 because 11! = 39916800 has 2 zeroes at the end. Given K, find how many
 * non-negative integers x have the property that f(x) = K.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: K = 0
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: 0!, 1!, 2!, 3!, and 4! end with K = 0 zeroes.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: K = 5
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: There is no x such that x! ends in K = 5 zeroes.
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *
 * K will be an integer in the range [0, 10^9].
