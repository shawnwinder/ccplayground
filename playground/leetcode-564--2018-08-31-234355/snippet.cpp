 * Testcase Example:  '"1"'
 *
 * Given an integer n, find the closest integer (not including itself), which
 * is a palindrome.
 *
 * The 'closest' is defined as absolute difference minimized between two
 * integers.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: "123"
 * Output: "121"
 *
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * The input n is a positive integer represented by string, whose length will
 * not exceed 18.
 * If there is a tie, return the smaller one as answer.
