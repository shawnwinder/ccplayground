 * Testcase Example:  '[4,3,2,3,5,2,1]\n4'
 *
 * Given an array of integers nums and a positive integer k, find whether it's
 * possible to divide this array into k non-empty subsets whose sums are all
 * equal.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [4, 3, 2, 3, 5, 2, 1], k = 4
 * Output: True
 * Explanation: It's possible to divide it into 4 subsets (5), (1, 4), (2,3),
 * (2,3) with equal sums.
 *
 *
 *
 * Note:
 * 1 .
 * 0 < nums[i] < 10000.
