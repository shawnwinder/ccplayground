 * Testcase Example:  '[[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]]\n4\n2'
 *
 *
 * There are N network nodes, labelled 1 to N.
 *
 * Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w),
 * where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w is the time it takes
 * for a signal to travel from source to target.
 *
 * Now, we send a signal from a certain node K.  How long will it take for all
 * nodes to receive the signal?  If it is impossible, return -1.
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * N will be in the range [1, 100].
 * K will be in the range [1, N].
 * The length of times will be in the range [1, 6000].
 * All edges times[i] = (u, v, w) will have 1  and 1 .
