 * algorithms
 * Hard (36.75%)
 * Total Accepted:    7.1K
 * Total Submissions: 19.3K
 * Testcase Example:  '[1,3,2,2,2,3,4,3,1]'
 *
 * Given several boxes with different colors represented by different positive
 * numbers.
 * You may experience several rounds to remove boxes until there is no box
 * left. Each time you can choose some continuous boxes with the same color
 * (composed of k boxes, k >= 1), remove them and get k*k points.
 * Find the maximum points you can get.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 *
 * [1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1]
 *
 * Output:
 *
 * 23
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * [1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1]
 * ----> [1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 1] (3*3=9 points)
 * ----> [1, 3, 3, 3, 1] (1*1=1 points)
 * ----> [1, 1] (3*3=9 points)
 * ----> [] (2*2=4 points)
 *
 *
 *
 * Note:
 * The number of boxes n would not exceed 100.
