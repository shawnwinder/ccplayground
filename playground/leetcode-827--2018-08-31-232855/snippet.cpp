/*
 * [854] Making A Large Island

 *
 * algorithms
 * Hard (40.49%)
 * Total Accepted:    4.3K
 * Total Submissions: 10.6K
 * Testcase Example:  '[[1,0],[0,1]]'
 *
 * In a 2D grid of 0s and 1s, we change at most one 0 to a 1.
 *
 * After, what is the size of the largest island?Â (An island is a
 * 4-directionally connected group of 1s).
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Change one 0 to 1 and connect two 1s, then we get an island
 * with area = 3.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: [[1, 1], [1, 0]]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Change the 0 to 1 and make the island bigger, only one island
 * with area = 4.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: [[1, 1], [1, 1]]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Can't change any 0 to 1, only one island with area = 4.
 *
 *
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= grid.length = grid[0].length <= 50.
 * 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 1.
