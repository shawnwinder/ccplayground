 *
 * A password is considered strong if below conditions are all met:
 *
 *
 * ⁠It has at least 6 characters and at most 20 characters.
 * ⁠It must contain at least one lowercase letter, at least one uppercase
 * letter, and at least one digit.
 * ⁠It must NOT contain three repeating characters in a row ("...aaa..." is
 * weak, but "...aa...a..." is strong, assuming other conditions are met).
 *
 *
 * Write a function strongPasswordChecker(s), that takes a string s as input,
 * and return the MINIMUM change required to make s a strong password. If s is
 * already strong, return 0.
 *
 * Insertion, deletion or replace of any one character are all considered as
 * one change.
